FIXES:

Day cell overflow problem:
For c-day classes, there is catch with setting overflow: hidden.
If it is set, then sometimes a blank line can appear between day cell highlights.
If it is not set, then transparent backgrounds can interfere with each other during animations.

THOUGHTS:

An attribute date specified as a range may also specify a filter function that slices up that range.
If a filter function is specified, then a new scanEnd date will need to be calculated using a maxLength
parameter on the date in order to know when to stop testing for a date match on that attribute.
