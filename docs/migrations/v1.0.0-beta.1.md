* [i18n Improvements](#i18n-improvements)

* [Attributes API](#attributes-api)
* [Popperjs Integration](#popperjs-integration)

### Responsive Layouts

In pre-v1 versions, you could just create double-paned calendars via the `is-double-paned` and `is-vertical` props. While better than nothing, only getting 2 columns with 1 row was kind of limiting and the built-in responsiveness was not great. Now, you have multiple props to configure your own layouts.

| | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `rows` | Number | Number of calendar pane rows |
| `columns` | Number | Number of calendar pane columns |

For responsive designs, you can use the newly provided `$screens` function to make these props responsive (or any other prop for that matter). For example, this will get you 2 columns and 2 rows on large layouts.
```html
<v-calendar
  :rows="$screens({ default: 1, lg: 2 })"
  :columns="$screens({ default: 1, lg: 2 })"
  />
```

One extra nicety: because this function is provided via a lightweight mixin, you can use it to make any prop on any component responsive.

#### i18n Improvements

Previously, you could only define a single locale for use by all instances of `v-calendar` in your application. Now, you can pass a `locale` prop to each instance of `v-calendar`. It can either be a locale string identifier or an object with your own custom localized settings. If you don't provide a `locale` prop, it still reverts to the locale detected by the browser.

Also, you can provide a locales object within your own defaults to provide info for any locales not natively detected by `v-calendar` or the browser.
