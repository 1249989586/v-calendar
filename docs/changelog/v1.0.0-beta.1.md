* [Modern Design](#modern-design)
* [Theming & Dark Mode](#theming-dark-mode)
* [Attributes API](#attributes-api)

* [Popperjs Integration](#popper-js-integration)
* [Defaults Restructuring](#defaults-restructuring)
* [Deprecations & Additions](#deprecations-additions)

### Responsive Layouts

In pre-v1 versions, you could just create double-paned calendars via the `is-double-paned` and `is-vertical` props. While better than nothing, only getting 2 columns with 1 row was kind of limiting and the built-in responsiveness was not great. Now, you have multiple props to configure your own layouts.

| | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `rows` | Number | Number of calendar pane rows |
| `columns` | Number | Number of calendar pane columns |

For responsive designs, you can use the newly provided `$screens` function to make these props responsive (or any other prop for that matter). For example, this will get you 2 columns and 2 rows on large layouts.
```html
<v-calendar
  :rows="$screens({ default: 1, lg: 2 })"
  :columns="$screens({ default: 1, lg: 2 })"
  />
```

One extra nicety: because this function is provided via a lightweight mixin, you can use it to make any prop on any component responsive.

### i18n Improvements

Previously, you could only define a single locale for use by all instances of `v-calendar` in your application. Now, you can pass a `locale` prop to each instance of `v-calendar`. It can either be a locale string identifier or an object with your own custom localized settings. If you don't provide a `locale` prop, it still reverts to the locale detected by the browser.

Also, you can provide a locales object within your own defaults to provide info for any locales not natively detected by `v-calendar` or the browser.

### Modern Design

In this release I went back to the drawing board with the design. I decided to go with a more modern look with the following goals:

* Cleaner, solid backgrounds
* Less borders
* Improved visual hierarchy

### Theming & Dark Mode

In deciding to modernize the design, I also wanted it to look great for multiple colors. That led to redesigning the theming system so that it would look great out of the box but also flexible for multiple scenarios.

### Attributes API

### Datepicker Improvements

### Popper.js Integration

All use of popovers, including atributes, the navigation pane and the date picker input, now use [Popper.js](popperjs.com) under the hood for more accurate and adaptable layout positioning. For example, if the window size doesn't allow for positioning the popover in the desired position, it will get rearranged to a new position visible to the user.

Also, each calendar shares a single popover for all day attributes. This helps improve performance and memory usage, as each day doesn't need to have its own separate popover instance.

### Defaults Restructuring
